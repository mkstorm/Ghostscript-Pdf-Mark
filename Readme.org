* About
A script to read a .pdf file with vector graphics and inject postscript code to specific coordinates, based on a indicator line in the pdf.
This example inserts a text and a graphic from an .eps file.
The injected postscript can be changed to a code block which is not nescessarily a text.

The application is set to surveil a folder and add the markings to an incomming pdf and output a new pdf file with the added graphics.

The use case for this application is for example to add a date or production marking to a large format print, the mark kan automatically be updated
by the computer, be it a date or otherwise.

* Functionality
The pdf should contain a line on a specific named layer in this case "Mark1", based on the direction of a the vector calculated from the line,
the added text or graphic is rotated.

The indicator on the "Mark1" layer in the pdf is beneath the the graphic which is supposed to be seen so it is invisible, but the added
text/graphic goes on top of everything else.
