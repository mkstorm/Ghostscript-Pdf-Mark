* About
A script to read a .pdf file with vector graphics and inject postscript code to specific coordinates, based on a indicator line in the pdf.
This example inserts a text and a graphic from an .eps file.
The injected postscript can be changed to a code block which is not nescessarily a text for example a logo.

The script also counts how many inserts there has been, to double check a production hasnt missed something by accident.

The application is set to surveil a folder and add the markings to an incomming pdf and output a new pdf file with the added graphics.

The use case for this application is for example to add a date or production marking to a large format print, the mark kan automatically be updated
by the computer, be it a date or otherwise.

* Functionality
The pdf should contain a line on a specific named layer, in this case we use "Mark1-Mark4", based on the direction of a the vector calculated from the line,
the added text or graphic is rotated.
The code has at the moment hard coded what should be added on each layer. Therefore the layer "Mark1" Gets the specified text: "In Red" and the external .eps drawing is inserted in front of the text.

The line indicator on the "Mark1" layer in the pdf, should be placed beneath the graphics, or be colored in the same color so it is not seen above the desired graphics. The added
text/graphic will be placedgoes on top of everything else.

* Examples in and output
Input example, where the green graphics has been drawn and is a done .pdf vector graphics file, it could be anything and be more complicated.

Here we have, as you can see below, colored the lines where the text and logo insertion is gonna be placed. the Lines is on the right corresponding layers.
Normally They are to be colored the same as the above object, or to be put at the bottom of the object list, so the "color" is not seen.
As an example we have also rotated the lines to show it still works with the insertions.

Output example, where the program has run, it has added an .eps "star" from a sepperate file. It vould be a logo or a watermark that should always be added to a product.

It has also drawn a text on the line in the layer specified by the user. The size and Font of the text is hardcoded but can be changed, just remember to configure Ghostscript.
The text could be a time indicater which always changes, making the finished product much faster to produce (and more precise).
