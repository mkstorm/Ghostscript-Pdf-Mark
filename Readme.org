* About
A script to read a .pdf file with vector graphics and inject postscript code to specific coordinates, based on a indicator line in the pdf.
This example inserts a text and a graphic from an .eps file.
The injected postscript can be changed to a code block which is not nescessarily a text for example a logo.

The application is set to surveil a folder and add the markings to an incomming pdf and output a new pdf file with the added graphics.

The use case for this application is for example to add a date or production marking to a large format print, the mark kan automatically be updated
by the computer, be it a date or otherwise.

* Functionality
The pdf should contain a line on a specific named layer in this case "Mark1", based on the direction of a the vector calculated from the line,
the added text or graphic is rotated.

The indicator on the "Mark1" layer in the pdf is beneath the the graphic which is supposed to be seen so it is invisible, but the added
text/graphic goes on top of everything else.


* Examples in and output
Input example, where the green graphics has been drawn and is a done .pdf vector graphics file, it could be anything and be more complicated.

Output example, where the program has run, it has added an .eps "star" from a sepperate file. It vould be a logo or a watermark that should always be added to a product.
It has also drawn a text on the line in the layer specified by the user. The size and Font of the text is hardcoded but can be changed, just remember to configure Ghostscript.
The text could be a time indicater which always changes, making the finished product much faster to produce (and more precise).
